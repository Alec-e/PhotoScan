            <span class="text-muted">PhotoScan is a lightweight application developed to scan uploaded images for location specific EXIF data. The photos we take every day contain more info then just our smiling faces and what food we ate that day. They can contain information as to where the photo was taken, at what time, and even the direction the photo was taken. Many sites strip this data once the photo is uploaded. Though some keep the information for their own use and even worse some do not strip the data at all. Make sure the sites you upload your photos too are trust worthy and well protected!</span>
